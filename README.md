# Project 5 - *Trivia-Gamee*

Submitted by: **Shaun Amoah**

**Trivia-Game** is an app that ... you choose whatever topic with any number of questions to be quizzed on as a fun brain teaser game  

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

  - [Y] Type of questions (Multiple Choice or True False)
